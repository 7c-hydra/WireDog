WireDog

This is a tool in development. 

This tool will run passively while you're on an internal network penetration test. It listens for traffic that is indicative of an insecurity then flags it to you for action. The following are included as insecure protocols: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, WPAD, etc. It will also alert you to IPv6 transiting the network. Any form of login occuring over the network will be captured and alert you to the details.
